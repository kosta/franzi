aborted transactions in the result, which allows consumers to discard
ABORTED transactional records
session_id	The fetch session ID
session_epoch	The fetch session epoch
topics	Topics to fetch in the order provided.
topic	Name of topic
partitions	Partitions to fetch.
partition	Topic partition id
current_leader_epoch	The current leader epoch, if provided, is used to
fence consumers/replicas with old metadata. If the epoch provided by the
client is larger than the current epoch known to the broker, then the
UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH error code will be returned. If the provided epoch
is smaller, then the FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH error code will be returned.
fetch_offset	Message offset.
log_start_offset	Earliest available offset of the follower replica. The
field is only used when request is sent by follower.
partition_max_bytes	Maximum bytes to fetch.
forgotten_topics_data	Topics to remove from the fetch session.
topic	Name of topic
partitions	Partitions to remove from the fetch session.

Field 	Description
replica_id	Broker id of the follower. For normal consumers, use -1.
max_wait_time	Maximum time in ms to wait for the response.
min_bytes	Minimum bytes to accumulate in the response.
max_bytes	Maximum bytes to accumulate in the response. Note that this is
not an absolute maximum, if the first message in the first non-empty
partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the message will still
be returned to ensure that progress can be made.
isolation_level	This setting controls the visibility of transactional
records. Using READ_UNCOMMITTED (isolation_level = 0) makes all records
visible. With READ_COMMITTED (isolation_level = 1), non-transactional
and COMMITTED transactional records are visible. To be more concrete,
READ_COMMITTED returns all data from offsets smaller than the current
LSO (last stable offset), and enables the inclusion of the list of
aborted transactions in the result, which allows consumers to discard
ABORTED transactional records
session_id	The fetch session ID
session_epoch	The fetch session epoch
topics	Topics to fetch in the order provided.
topic	Name of topic
partitions	Partitions to fetch.
partition	Topic partition id
current_leader_epoch	The current leader epoch, if provided, is used to
fence consumers/replicas with old metadata. If the epoch provided by the
client is larger than the current epoch known to the broker, then the
UNKNOWN_LEADER_EPOCH error code will be returned. If the provided epoch
is smaller, then the FENCED_LEADER_EPOCH error code will be returned.
fetch_offset	Message offset.
log_start_offset	Earliest available offset of the follower replica. The
field is only used when request is sent by follower.
partition_max_bytes	Maximum bytes to fetch.
forgotten_topics_data	Topics to remove from the fetch session.

        Some Common Philosophical Questions <#protocol_philosophy>

Some people have asked why we don't use HTTP. There are a number of
reasons, the best is that client implementors can make use of some of
the more advanced TCP features--the ability to multiplex requests, the
ability to simultaneously poll many connections, etc. We have also found
HTTP libraries in many languages to be surprisingly shabby.

Others have asked if maybe we shouldn't support many different
protocols. Prior experience with this was that it makes it very hard to
add and test new features if they have to be ported across many protocol
implementations. Our feeling is that most users don't really see
multiple protocols as a feature, they just want a good reliable client
in the language of their choice.

Another question is why we don't adopt XMPP, STOMP, AMQP or an existing
protocol. The answer to this varies by protocol, but in general the
problem is that the protocol does determine large parts of the
implementation and we couldn't do what we are doing if we didn't have
control over the protocol. Our belief is that it is possible to do
better than existing messaging systems have in providing a truly
distributed messaging system, and to do this we need to build something
that works differently.

A final question is why we don't use a system like Protocol Buffers or
Thrift to define our request messages. These packages excel at helping
you to managing lots and lots of serialized messages. However we have
only a few messages. Support across languages is somewhat spotty
(depending on the package). Finally the mapping between binary log
format and wire protocol is something we manage somewhat carefully and
this would not be possible with these systems. Finally we prefer the
style of versioning APIs explicitly and checking this to inferring new
values as nulls as it allows more nuanced control of compatibility.
